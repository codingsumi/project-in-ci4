                    <h2>From the desk of Secretary’s </h2>
                    <p>The profession of nursing is unique. Its primary focus is caring the sick and managing the
                        preventive, promotive and rehabilitative health needs of clients. It is growing with current
                        trends and technologies in health care system.
                    </p>
                    <p>In India, on an average, there is one nurse for 483 persons thereby, there is a shortage of
                        nearly twenty lakh nurses. Added to this, Bihar is lagging behind other states in a no. of the
                        health care indicators. Lackness in health care service provisions is an important reason for
                        the state of affairs. Requirements for technically skilled personnel dedicated to health care
                        services are immense. So, it is important to join hands for filling the gap of trained manpower
                        in health service sector.</p>
                    <p>Career of a professional nurse is one of the most rewarding career one can pursue. It provides
                        the job security, throws challenges for intellectual development &amp; growth, gives flexibility
                        and opportunities to make positive contribution and difference in the lives of people each and
                        every day. Helping someone else in building or maintaining a healthy quality of life is all the
                        more important and satisfying service. </p>
